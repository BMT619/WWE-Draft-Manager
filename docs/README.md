## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### Planning Your Roster

1. **Balance Your Roster**: Try to add a good mix of:
   - Main event stars
   - Mid-card talent
   - Tag teams
   - Factions

2. **Consider Brand Identity**: After drafting, you might want to:
   - Manually adjust if a brand feels too stacked
   - Re-draft until you get a distribution you like

3. **Use Realistic Numbers**: For a balanced Universe Mode:
   - 15-25 solo superstars per brand
   - 4-6 tag teams per brand
   - 1-3 factions per brand

### Naming Conventions

- **Tag Teams**: Enter the team name (e.g., "The Usos" not "Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso")
- **Factions**: Use the faction name (e.g., "The Bloodline" not individual members)
- **Solo Superstars**: Use ring names or real names consistently

### Workflow Suggestions

1. **Prepare a List**: Write down your roster beforehand
2. **Add by Category**: Add all solos first, then tags, then factions
3. **Review Before Drafting**: Double-check your pool before running the draft
4. **Save Your Results**: Take a screenshot or write down the results for reference

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### The page won't load
- Make sure you saved the file with the `.html` extension
- Try opening in a different browser
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser

### "RUN DRAFT" button is disabled
- You need to add at least one superstar/team to the draft pool first
- Make sure you have at least one brand configured

### The draft seems uneven
- The app distributes entries round-robin style
- If you have 10 superstars and 3 brands, one brand will have 4, two will have 3
- This is mathematically unavoidable and as fair as possible

### I want to export my results
- Take a screenshot of the results page
- Copy and paste the results into a text document
- Use the browser's print function to save as PDF

### The page looks broken
- Make sure you copied the entire HTML file
- Try clearing your browser cache
- Ensure you have an internet connection for the first load (to load external libraries)
